# Nginx Nomad

https://hub.docker.com/r/ygersie/nginx-ldap-lua

We've been running hashi-ui quite a lot. As it's currently possible to, besides viewing job statistics,
also edit and manage jobs, the need started to arise to put it behind some form of authentication. Here's where it becomes a bit more
challenging. If you, like we do, run hashi-ui on Nomad itself the service is allocated a dynamic port on a "random" worker. Your average
proxy server can be configured using something like [consul-template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template) but what if you also
want to run your proxy scheduled in a container? You'd like to do backend lookups from Consul.

Nginx Plus (commercial) supports a feature to lookup SRV records in an upstream block but hey, not everyone wants to buy a commercial
license just for this feature. After some searching I came across [this Github project](https://github.com/vlipco/srv-router).
A project that utilizes the Nginx Lua module to do SRV record lookups. I've adjusted the script to remove the service name derived from
alias logic. Instead you can configure a variable in the nginx config `service` which should be set to the FQDN as served by Consul.
The docker container is compiled with the ldap and lua module along with LuaJIT 2.0.

In the example Nomad job you'll find that a Consul **tag** has been configured starting with `urlprefix-`. This is an identifier tag for
[Fabio](https://github.com/eBay/fabio) If you haven't heard of Fabio before please check it out. It's an awesome piece of software which
dynamically creates routes based on Consul services.

**NOTES:**
* There's no caching mechanism in the Lua script, if you expect high number of requests you might want to setup dnsmasq with caching or
integrate [lua-lrucache](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-lrucache)
